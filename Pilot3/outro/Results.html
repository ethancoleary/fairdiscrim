<b>Your investment results</b> <br>
<p>
    You chose to invest {{ inv }} tokens and kept the remaining {{ kept }} tokens.
</p>
<p>
The fair die was rolled and landed on the number {{ die }}.
This means that your investment {{ if player.lottery == 0 }} was lost. {{ endif }}
{{ if player.lottery == 1 }} will deliver 2.5 times {{ inv  }}. {{ endif }}
    </p>
<p>
Therefore, your final token balance is equal to {{ earning }} meaning you will
receive a bonus payment equal to ${{ bonus }}. You will receive this within one week.

<b>Your extra participation fee</b><br>
<p>
    {{ If player.participant.receive == 1 }}
You received an extra participation fee of $0.50. As we previously mentioned,
    this sum may have been affected by a decision in the experiment.
    Your match had the opportunity to transfer the fee to themselves.
    If your match chose not to do this, you will receive your extra participation
    fee with your bonus payment.
{{ endif }}
{{ If player.participant.receive == 0 }}
You received an extra participation fee of $0.50.
{{ if player.participant.steal == 0 }}
    You chose to not transfer your match's participation fee to yourself.
    You will both receive this amount together with your bonus payment.
{{ endif }}
{{ if player.participant.steal }}
    You chose to transfer your match's participation fee.
    You will therefore receive ${{ participation_fee }} together with your bonus payment.
{{ endif }}
{{ endif }}
