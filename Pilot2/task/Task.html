Your task is now to give 300 tokens to either
<span style="color: #30C34C; font-weight: bold;">Individual A</span> or
<span style="color: #913CC6; font-weight: bold;">Individual B</span>.
Recall that, based on their responses to our questionnaire on preferences,
<span style="color: #30C34C; font-weight: bold;">Individual A</span> belongs to
<span style="color: #30C34C; font-weight: bold;">Group A</span> and
<span style="color: #913CC6; font-weight: bold;">Individual B</span> belongs to
<span style="color: #913CC6; font-weight: bold;">Group B</span>.
Also recall that in a previous experiment, individuals from
<span style="color: #30C34C; font-weight: bold;">Group A</span> invested on average 100 tokens,
while individuals from <span style="color: #913CC6; font-weight: bold;">Group B</span>
invested on average 80 tokens.
<br><br>
Which of the two individuals would you like to give the 300 tokens to?
You will earn a bonus payment equal to 1 cent for every 5 tokens your chosen
individual invests in the lottery (rounded up to the nearest cent).
