    {{ if player.participant.group == 1 }}You chose painting A and so are a member of Group A.

Soon each of you will be given some tokens as an "investment budget".
    Each token has a real dollar value of 1 cent.
    You will need to decide how many tokens from your investment budget you wish to invest in the following lottery.
</p>
<p>
<center>
    <u>Lottery</u><br><i>A fair six-sided die will be rolled. If the die lands on a 1 or a 2, you will
    win two and half times the amount you invest.
    If the die lands on a number higher than 2 (3, 4, 5 or 6), you will
    lose the amount you invest.</i>
</center>
</p>
<p>
    The die is rolled independently for each individual.
    This means that your success does not guarantee your match's success and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
    Your bonus payment will be equal to the dollar worth of the tokens remaining in your investment budget
    plus any earnings from the lottery. Half tokens are rounded up.

On the next page you will learn how you and your match will be allocated tokens.
