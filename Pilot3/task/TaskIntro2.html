A random painting will be chosen (A and B) and the individual in your pair who chose that painting
will be given an investment budget of 300 tokens.
The other individual will receive an investment budget of 100 tokens.
</p>
<p>
    Before moving on to the last page of instructions and learning how many tokens you have been allocated,
    you must answer the following questions to check your understanding of the instructions up to now.
    You will earn $0.50 by answering these questions correctly.
</p>
<p>
This $0.50 is an extra participation fee and is not added to your investment budget.
    This extra participation fee may be affected by the decisions of yourself and your match later in the experiment.
