Prior to this experiment, we conducted another experiment wherein we recruited a group of
individuals who had to make an investment decision.
Before making their decision, the participants answered a questionnaire about their likes which
helped us to classify them into one of two groups:
<span style="color: #30C34C; font-weight: bold;">Group A</span>  and
<span style="color: #913CC6; font-weight: bold;">Group B</span>.
<br><br>
Each participant was given 200 tokens, each worth 1 cent.
They had to decide how many of their tokens they wished to invest in the following lottery.
<br><br>
<center>
    <u>Lottery</u><br><i>A fair die will be rolled. If the die lands on a 1 or a 2, you will
    win two and half times the amount you bet.
    If the die lands on a number higher than 2 (3, 4, 5 or 6), you will
    lose the amount you bet.</i></center>
<br><br>
Their bonus payment would then be equal to the dollar worth of their bonus payment pot.
This pot contains the tokens they did not invest in the lottery
plus their payoff from the lottery. Half tokens were rounded up.
<br><br>
For example, suppose that they invested 100 tokens in the lottery.
The computer would roll a fair die and if it landed on a 1 or a 2,
then they would earn 250 (2.5 times your investment) tokens from the lottery.
In this case, their bonus payment pot would contain the tokens they
kept (100) plus their earning from the lottery (250) amounting to a bonus payment of $3.50.
If the computer were to roll any other number then their investment returns nothing and
their bonus payment would amount to $1.00.
