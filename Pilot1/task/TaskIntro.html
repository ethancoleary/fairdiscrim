Now you must complete a task which will determine your bonus payment.
<br><br>
For this task, you will be given 200 tokens, each worth 1 cent.
You must decide how many of your tokens you wish to invest in the following lottery.
<br><br>
<center>
    <u>Lottery</u><br><i>A fair die will be rolled. If the die lands on a 1 or a 2, you will
    win two and half times the amount you bet.
    If the die lands on a number higher than 2 (3, 4, 5 or 6), you will
    lose the amount you bet.</i></center>
<br><br>
Your bonus payment will then be equal to the dollar worth of the number of
tokens you do not invest in the lottery plus your payoff from the lottery. Half tokens are rounded up.
<br><br>
For example, suppose that you invest 100 tokens in the lottery.
The computer will roll a fair die and if it lands on a 1 or a 2,
then you will earn 250 (2.5 times your investment) tokens from the lottery.
In this case, your bonus payment will be the dollar worth of the number of tokens you
kept (100) plus your earning from the lottery (250) amounting to $3.50.
If the computer rolls any other number then your investment returns nothing and
your bonus payment is $1.00.
<br><br>
In the next page you must decide how many of your tokens you would like to invest.
